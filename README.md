This site is a collection of my work, experiments, and ideas. You may notice there are extra files here and there — that’s because I like to explore different approaches while building. I don’t or cant't always stick to a single thought process when creating, and I believe that’s part of the my journey.

If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or just ask me about something in this repo, feel free to drop a message through the Contact Form on my portfolio website. I’ll make sure to respond. ✉️
